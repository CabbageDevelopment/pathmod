## Introduction

`pathmod` is a CLI program which allows you to easily modify the PATH using the terminal on Windows. `pathmod` can persistently modify the PATH, and provides an easy way to refresh the path in the current session. 

## Requirements

You need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed. This will allow you to install `pathmod` with Python's package manager, `pip`. 

## How to install 

To install `pathmod` with `pip`:

```bash
pip install pathmod
```

## Quick start

After installation with `pip`, the `pathmod` executable should be available on the PATH.
